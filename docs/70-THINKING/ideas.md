# Ideas

*A running register of unvetted ideas thrown off by the THINKING work:
experiments to run, methods to try, design moves to consider. Low ceremony. Each
entry carries its provenance and what is open before it would be worth
committing. When an idea matures it graduates to where committed things live —
the research-and-evaluation agenda, the open-questions register, or a design
document — and its entry here records where it went.*

*This is not a design surface. Nothing here constrains anything, and an idea
sitting here is not a plan to act on it.*

## I1 — Use logical-equivalence sets to measure the lift of a pipeline shape

**Provenance.** Turned around from the invariance finding in
`07-when-to-decompose/` sheet `07` (Madhwal et al.): pipeline variants that are
provably the same computation still diverge on 40–60% of hard inputs.

**The idea.** If semantics is held constant across a set of pipeline shapes, then
any systematic accuracy or cost difference between them is attributable to the
shape alone. So: for each of a variety of problems, construct a set of
logically-equivalent decomposition and execution shapes; run every shape; record
accuracy and cost. The spread across shapes, with semantics controlled, is a
direct measurement of the quantity the invariance finding says is real but that
nobody isolates — the lift of a shape. Repeat across several models to separate
shape advantages that are model-specific from those that hold in general.

**Why it is worth doing.** It converts "the shape of the system shapes the
outcome" from a caution into a measurable design input, and it gives an empirical
basis for choosing a shape — which sheet `07` argues cannot be done by
equivalence-preserving reasoning.

**Open before it is worth committing.**

- How to generate genuinely semantically-equivalent shape sets at scale without a
  hand-verification bottleneck. Sheet `07` hand-verified every plan.
- What "shape" is varied: topology, call granularity, how much context is passed
  down, recombination method.
- How many shapes and how many problems the spread needs before it means
  anything.
- Whether the result is stable across reruns, given the no-variance problem sheet
  `07` had.
- Each shape must be *commanded*, not sampled and binned after the fact — see
  `07-when-to-decompose/00d-findings.md` F4 on the reverse-causation confound in
  observed-length curves.

**Would graduate to** `00-design/40-roadmap/03-research-and-evaluation-agenda.md`.
