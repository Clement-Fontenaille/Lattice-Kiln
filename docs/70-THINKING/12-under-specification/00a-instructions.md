# When the Request Is Not Enough

*A literature review of how LLM-based agent systems handle under-specified, ambiguous, or false-premise requests.*

## Subject

A request handed to an agent system is often incomplete, ambiguous, or built on a
false premise, and the system must decide whether to proceed on an assumption,
ask a clarifying question, decline, or report what is missing. Approaches range
from silently guessing, through interactive clarification, to structured triage
that classifies a request and routes or blocks it with a statement of what it
needs. Work here covers clarification-question generation, ambiguity and
false-premise detection, knowing when to ask rather than act, and refusal or
abstention on requests that cannot be satisfied as stated. Recurring concerns
include the cost of over-asking, detecting under-specification reliably, and
whether models default to compliance. The topic sits within the wider bodies of
work on interactive task completion, clarification dialogue, and agent
robustness.

## Task

Characterise the recent research literature on the Subject. Collect and describe
only — do not test the literature against any expectation, and do not connect
anything to material outside this file. **No conclusion is expected in this pass:
no synthesis across papers, no ranking, no answer to any question.** Each paper is
described on its own; the cross-paper discussion happens later, separately,
finding by finding. (This protocol is copied into each topic file so the file is
self-contained.)

### Step 1 — inventory

Collect **every peer-reviewed paper (2023 onward)** on the Subject — published or
accepted at a journal, conference, or reviewed workshop. arXiv-only preprints are
out of scope unless otherwise published; if one is clearly central, note it in a
single line as excluded-pending-publication and move on. For each in-scope paper,
record in this file: the cite line (authors, title, year, venue, DOI/arXiv,
link), **the full abstract quoted verbatim**, and a flag — **RELATED** /
**ADJACENT** / **NOT RELATED** to the Subject — with one line of reason. Do not
review or paraphrase
yet. The inventory is the audit trail for what was and was not looked at, and the
abstracts are the material Step 2 selects from.

Pre-2023 work is in scope only where the later papers repeatedly build on it;
list it and mark it as an anchor.

### Step 2 — select four

From the RELATED set, pick **four papers** to review in full, working from the
collected abstracts. **Select for spread, not fit** — four papers that span
approach, method, and claim, not the four that sit closest to the Subject's
framing. Record one line per pick saying why it was chosen.

### Step 3 — review each of the four

Each of the four picks gets its own sheet in this folder: `01-<slug>.md` …
`04-<slug>.md`. The sheet format lives in `00b-template.md` (shared, identical
across all nine topics), and it opens with a one-line **density** flag. The
inventory and the four picks are recorded in `00c-inventory.md`; the cross-paper
discussion, when it happens, goes in `00d-findings.md`.
