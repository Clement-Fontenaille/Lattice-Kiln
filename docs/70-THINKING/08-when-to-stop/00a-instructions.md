# Knowing When to Stop

*A literature review of how LLM-based agent systems judge whether their own work is done, failing, or beyond them.*

## Subject

An agent system acting in a loop repeatedly decides whether the current attempt
has succeeded, is still making progress, has stalled, or should be abandoned or
handed off. That judgement can come from the model's own report on its work, from
an external check (a test, a verifier, a rule), or from a signal in the
trajectory itself — no state change, repeated actions, an exhausted budget.
Closely related are calibration, whether a model's stated or implicit confidence
tracks its actual accuracy, and abstention, whether and how a system declines to
answer when it should. Work here spans self-evaluation and self-critique,
uncertainty estimation, stopping criteria for iterative and agentic loops, and
the reliability of a model as a judge of its own output. The topic sits within
the wider bodies of work on LLM calibration, hallucination, and agent
reliability.

## Task

Characterise the recent research literature on the Subject. Collect and describe
only — do not test the literature against any expectation, and do not connect
anything to material outside this file. **No conclusion is expected in this pass:
no synthesis across papers, no ranking, no answer to any question.** Each paper is
described on its own; the cross-paper discussion happens later, separately,
finding by finding. (This protocol is copied into each topic file so the file is
self-contained.)

### Step 1 — inventory

Collect **every peer-reviewed paper (2023 onward)** on the Subject — published or
accepted at a journal, conference, or reviewed workshop. arXiv-only preprints are
out of scope unless otherwise published; if one is clearly central, note it in a
single line as excluded-pending-publication and move on. For each in-scope paper,
record in this file: the cite line (authors, title, year, venue, DOI/arXiv,
link), **the full abstract quoted verbatim**, and a flag — **RELATED** /
**ADJACENT** / **NOT RELATED** to the Subject — with one line of reason. Do not
review or paraphrase
yet. The inventory is the audit trail for what was and was not looked at, and the
abstracts are the material Step 2 selects from.

Pre-2023 work is in scope only where the later papers repeatedly build on it;
list it and mark it as an anchor.

### Step 2 — select four

From the RELATED set, pick **four papers** to review in full, working from the
collected abstracts. **Select for spread, not fit** — four papers that span
approach, method, and claim, not the four that sit closest to the Subject's
framing. Record one line per pick saying why it was chosen.

### Step 3 — review each of the four

Each of the four picks gets its own sheet in this folder: `01-<slug>.md` …
`04-<slug>.md`. The sheet format lives in `00b-template.md` (shared, identical
across all nine topics), and it opens with a one-line **density** flag. The
inventory and the four picks are recorded in `00c-inventory.md`; the cross-paper
discussion, when it happens, goes in `00d-findings.md`.
